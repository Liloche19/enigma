# Enigma - Python

## A clone of the Enigma machine

This is a reproduction of the Enigma machine used by the nazis during WW2.
It contains the most commons rotors and reflectors used during this period.

All the rotors values has been found on [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_rotor_details).

It has been written in Python with classes.

I tried to perfectly recreate the behavior of the machine.
